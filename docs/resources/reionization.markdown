Most of my research is about Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization. These
eras refer to the universe about 13 billion years ago, when the very first stars
and galaxies formed. The light emitted by these objects ionized the low-density
gas between them, heating up the gas and leaving a distinctive imprint on the
large scale structure of the universe. Although we are starting to make some
important measurements about this part of the universe's history, many of the
details of this process are unknown. It is also one of the final observational
frontiers in astronomy: galaxies from the post-reionization universe have been
cataloged and studied in great detail, and the [Cosmic Microwave
Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) from well
before reionization has been measured to exquisite precision. Reionization is
one of the final frontiers!

Unfortunately, measuring reionization directly is very challenging. The stars
and galaxies that drive reionization are typically much smaller than our own
Milky Way galaxy, and they are much fainter because of how far away they
are. Alternatively, we can use the [21-cm signal from neutral
hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line) to observe the gas
between galaxies instead. This has its own set of challenges, many of which are
due to emission from our own galaxy swamping the expected signal level. There
are other potential ways of detecting reionization, including hints in the
cosmic microwave background. So far though, a significant detection has remained
elusive.

Experiments such as the [Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array
(HERA)](https://reionization.org) are close to making a detection of
reionization. We will definitely be able to learn a lot about these early stars
from a detection, and maybe even some more fundamental cosmological
information. At the same time, we might think of new questions we want to ask
given our updated understanding of things. My research is focused on building
ways to extract as much information about reionization as possible from
measurements in the near future, and help make those measurements from HERA come
to fruition. Throughout all of my projects, I make use of computational
techniques that help us understand the measurements we make from different
telescopes and observatories, and connect them to underlying physical
models. One technique I'm very excited about is machine learning, which is being
applied to cosmology research in lots of neat ways!
