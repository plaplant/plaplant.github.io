HERA has partnered with the [Cal-Bridge Summer
(CAMPARE)](https://www.cpp.edu/calbridge/summer-research/index.shtml) program to
sponsor the [CAMPARE-HERA Astronomy Minority
Partnership](https://www.cpp.edu/calbridge/summer-research/research/champ/index.shtml). Each
year, HERA hosts a one-week camp that introduces concepts relevant to research
in the collaboration. [The collection of these
lessons](https://github.com/HERA-Team/CHAMP_Bootcamp) include [an introduction
to the
shell](https://github.com/HERA-Team/CHAMP_Bootcamp/blob/master/Lesson2_IntroToComputing/shell_intro_notes.pdf),
[scientific programming in
Python](https://github.com/HERA-Team/CHAMP_Bootcamp/tree/master/Lesson4_PythonProgramming),
and [how to use a semi-numeric reionization simulation
package](https://github.com/HERA-Team/CHAMP_Bootcamp/tree/master/Lesson9_Reionization_and_21cmFAST).
