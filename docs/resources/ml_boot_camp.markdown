Learning about how to do machine learning research can be daunting, so to help
provide some guidance, I have put together [a series of hands-on lessons for
learning about machine
learning](https://github.com/plaplant/ml_boot_camp). These include an
[introduction to deep learning theory and some
terminology](https://github.com/plaplant/ml_boot_camp/blob/master/notebooks/Lesson1.ipynb),
[using a deep neural network to recognize hand-written
digits](https://github.com/plaplant/ml_boot_camp/blob/master/notebooks/Lesson2.ipynb),
and [an introduction to convolutional neural
networks](https://github.com/plaplant/ml_boot_camp/blob/master/notebooks/Lesson3.ipynb). All
of the lessons make use of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), a popular
package for doing machine learning research. The lessons are in the form of
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and feature code and explanations
side-by-side. Feel free to check out the GitHub repo, and file an issue if you
have any questions!
