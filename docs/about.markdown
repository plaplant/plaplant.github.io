Hi! My name is Paul La Plante. I am a researcher interested in astronomy,
astrophysics, and cosmology. Currently I am a Fellow at the [Berkeley Center for
Cosmological Physics](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/), and I am a member of the
[HERA](https://reionization.org) and [Simons
Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org) collaborations. My primary focus is
on Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, which you can read about on my
[research page](/research). I use a lot of different computational techniques,
which I blend with modeling, forecasting, and data analysis to learn new things
about the universe. In particular, I am interested in machine learning and
finding ways to apply new ways of looking at existing problems. I am also
passionate about developing resources for anyone to learn about physics and
scientific computing, which you can find on my [resources page](/resources). If
you're interested in chatting with me, please feel free to [email
me](mailto:plaplant@berkeley.edu) or visit [my page on
GitHub](https://github.com/plaplant)!
