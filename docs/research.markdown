My research focuses on Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization. I primarily
use computational methods, with applications to cosmological simulations,
theoretical modeling, or data analysis. Here are some highlights of the type of
work I've done in the past. For a list of my publications on NASA/ADS, please

## Cosmological Simulations

I have designed and run [large-scale cosmological
simulations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...841...87L/abstract) of
[helium
reionization](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...868..106L/abstract),
which included developing a [model of populating volumes with sources
self-consistently](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...828...90L/abstract). I
have also helped develop [semi-numeric methods of galaxy formation for hydrogen
reionization](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201209189M/abstract),
and [explored implications for upcoming observations of 21cm
radiation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789...31L/abstract). Currently
I am the PI or co-PI of several [XSEDE grants](https://www.xsede.org/) whose
scientific goals include running a new suite of hydrogen reionization
simulations.


## Machine Learning

I make use of machine learning methods in both analyzing cosmological
simulations and assuring data quality in telescope data. I have used
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to [develop new methods for analyzing
upcoming 21cm
data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880..110L/abstract). I have
also applied CNNs to data from [HERA](https://reionization.org) to find [radio
frequency interference (RFI)
events](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488.2605K/abstract). I am
also interested in approximate Bayesian neural networks as a way of defining
robust error estimates when using machine learning techniques.


## Cross-correlation

I have [explored the possibility of cross-correlating upcoming 21cm data and CMB
data to infer reionization
properties](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...40L/abstract). I
was also a primary co-author of [a white-paper on
cross-correlation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51c.394L/abstract)
for the Astro2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, emphasizing
opportunities for cross-correlations in the coming decade of astronomy.


## Processing "Big Data"

I am the principal developer of
[hera_opm](https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_opm), a package for easily defining
workflows for data files and executing them efficiently. I am also a developer
and current maintainer of the
[librarian](https://github.com/HERA-Team/librarian), a package for long-term
data storage and movement between computing facilities. Both of these systems
work together to form the [HERA Real-Time Processing
system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201011969L/abstract), an
integral part of the experiment. The development of this infrastructure helped
analyze [some of the first data taken by the HERA
telescope](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...58K/abstract). I am
also the principal developer of the [UVH5 file
format](https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyuvdata/tree/main/docs/references/uvh5_memo.pdf),
an HDF5-based standard for storing interferometer visibility data for radio
telescopes.
